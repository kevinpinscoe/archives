First of all, I will cover the conversion -- the programme that you were 
told about is called EXE2BIN.  The bad news:  It used to come with DOS 
but not any more.  The good news:  you only need it if your assembler 
creates *.OBJ files that are linked with a linker to create *.EXE files.  
You then have to convert the *.EXE files to binary format so they can be 
loaded directly.  One assembler that can assemble directly from source 
code to binary or *.COM format ia the A86 assembler.  With that, you 
don't need EXE2BIN at all.  I have a link to the home page of A86's 
creator and distributor in my "Computer Hints, Tips, and Utilities" page 
on my web site.  See my signature for the site address.

The format of a device driver is more complicated and I would be logged 
off before I could describe all of the functions that a device driver has 
to handle so here are some references:

These should get you started.
