Using Pine to read Netscape email archives
I archive all of my Netscape and Mozilla email to compact disc. I needed a quick way
to read my archives without having to restore the files back into Mozilla.
<br><br>
This method I have come up with at least partially provides a solution:
<br><br>
Copy the archived mail to the local directory:
<br><br>
<tt>
$ mkdir nsmail<br>
$ cp "/mnt/cdrom/mail2002_4/Mail/Archived Mail.sbd/Kevin Personal.sbd/cfgeeks" nsmail/
Inbox<br>
</tt>
<br>
Because the file comes from a read-only file system (cdrom) we will have to make it wr
itable.
<br><br>
<tt>$ chmod +w nsmail/Inbox</tt><br>
<br>
Update <tt>$HOME/.pinerc</tt>
<br><br>
<tt>incoming-folders=NS-inbox nsmail/Inbox</tt>
<br><br>
Unfortunately you have to copy the message file to local storage because the cdrom is
read-only.
<br><br>
If anyone knows a way to get around this please let me <a href="mailto:kevin@inscoe.or
