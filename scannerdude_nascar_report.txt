This posting will cover several areas, so I'm cross-posting it to 4
lists.  It is somewhat long and covers racing, Volusia County, and
Daytona.

As part of my yearly tradition I went to the 2001 Twin 125 qualifying
races on Thursday (GREAT racing, by the way!).  I brought both my 245xlt
and 780xlt, and they served me very well.


RACING
I bought one of the trackside frequency lists for $5.00.  Not a bad deal
since they confirm most of them before Thursday from races and practice
earlier in the week.  Last year I bought the list from "Race-Scan
Communicaitons", this year from "Track Scan".  In both cases the lists
were right on.  The attenuator function on the 245xlt (and any other
model that has it) is a MUST for use in the stands - you have RF all
around you from the race teams, media, NASCAR officials, and team
"spotters".  The antenna was not needed where I was (Winston Tower
seats), but it's possible that lower seats might need it.  I used banks
1
through 4 for driver freqs, while the rest were for NASCAR and Public
Safety.

Interesting sidenote, no team is using 800-MHz simplex anymore.  My
understanding is that the FCC does not allow simplex use in the 800-MHz
band - if that's correct, could it be that the FCC cracked down on them
and said "no more 800 simplex use"?


MEDIA
I found the usual 454.000 used by MRN, but the audio was low.  I also
found several IFB's in use by FOX Network covering the race:

450.300
450.425
450.5875
450.650
450.7125
455.300

This is nice because they have a large TV screen at pit road showing the
FOX broadcast, so you can listen to the FOX audio and see what's they're
talking about on the screen.  MRN is broadcast over the track
loudspeakers.


PUBLIC SAFETY
Daytona Beach uses the Volusia County EDACS system #2 (SysID 0002) for
normal operations.  However, they use system #3 (SysID 0014) for ALL
Speedway event operations.  This system is licensed to Daytona Beach
under WPLZ211.  ALL 14-xxx talkgroups were heard ONLY on this system,
and
NOT on System 1 or 2.  I had two scanners going to confirm this - one on
system #3 tracking the Daytona events, the other listening to system #1
and #2 one at a time.  The 14-xxx NEVER came active on either system #1
or #2.

So, to listen to traffic control and security for racing events, USE
SYSTEM 3!  The frequencies are:

FREQ        LCN
856.7125        1
857.2125        2
858.2125        3
859.2125        4
860.2125        5

Main talkgroups for use at the track:
14-005 = Speedway Security
14-010 = Event Traffic
14-011 = Car-to-Car of 14-010

Daytona Beach is licensed to other frequencies as well but I did NOT
hear
them active:

under WPLZ211:
856.9375
857.7125
857.9375
858.9375
859.9375
860.9375

under KNNQ365
866.1000
866.3500
866.6000
866.8375
867.0875
867.3375
867.5875
868.0750
868.3250
868.5750
868.8250


MISC.
I have a WinScan 1.0 file for the 245xlt that covers the teams, NASCAR
officials, and the local trunked systems if anyone wants it.  It does
not
have talkgroups in it, only the system frequencies.  But it will allow
you to follow what's happening in the area.  E-mail me if you want it.
