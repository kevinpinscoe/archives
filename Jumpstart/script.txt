t was pointed out there's a script to create a Jumpstart server,
but I already had a working image (sans SUNWCprog and higher).

The solution is to run add_to_install_server (its in the Tools
directory of the second CD) and you should be away. Something like:

/mnt/Solaris_8/Tools/add_to_install_server /export/solaris8_cd1

Caveats:

        * There is a bug in the script if you nominate a relative
          path for the location of your cd image. It won't complain
          or fail to run, but it will assure you with a straight face
          that you've already copied all the packages.

        * The script doesn't work under pdksh. Not a problem for most
          but our jumpstart server is presently a laptop running
          FreeBSD, so ugly fudge required.
