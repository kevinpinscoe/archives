The famous 'Purple wire' mod

Isn't it annoying, when you're fine-tuning the radio and as the frequency
changes, so it makes that awful 'Chuff Chuff' noise? Here's how to get rid
of it.

Take off the top cover (mind the speaker wire, it's a bit short). With the
display facing you, just by the left-hand end of the ferrite bar antenna
are two connectors. The nearest one is CN1. The second wire in this is
purple, and needs to be cut. That's it!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frequency display calibration

NOTE: This is for SSB Only. (Not tried AM since doing the calibration)

1. Remove the top cover by removing 2 screws at rear & then sliding up &
back the top cover (Do this with the power off!)

2. With the radio facing you locate 2 Blue crystals named x2 / x2. Near the
front. Next to these should be a trimmer capacitor with a small screwdriver
slot. (Note- these are on the underside of the board in my own '394- Ed)

3. The Left one is LSB The right one is USB. (I only adjusted the right on
mine)

4. Turn the power on.

5. Tune to get the best reception to a constant signal (volmet around 5Mhz
will do nicely.) Now adjust the right hand preset to 'move' the signal up a
little. Re-tune the main tuning control toward the correct frequency
readout - Do these a little at a time 'chasing' yourself until the signal
sounds good & the readout is correct.

This should be tried against a few signals to get the best overall
performance. Mine is now within .05 just about all over the range.

Keyboard Beeps

To disable keyboard beeps, firstly do not take the lid off! Someone
suggested that the beeps can be disabled by removing a certain resistor
from the main board; this sounds far too permanent for my taste. It's a lot
simpler.

To disable beeps, power off and hold down CLEAR key whilst switching back
on.

To re-enable beeps, power off and hold down PGM key whilst switching back
on.

Fast AGC

Bridge C163 with 100uf cap for slow AGC, 47uf for fast AGC. C163 is located
on the bottom of the main board with the radio knobs facing you. It is on
the right near center just below Q9 with four surface mount components to
the left.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

RF Gain

Gain: Bridge a 4.7K ohm resistor across R184 (helps gain control).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bandwidth

Bridge .01/.047/.22uf cap across R64 (narrower bandwidth/crosstalk).

Bridge .1/.22uf cap across R91 (narrower bandwidth/crosstalk).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Noise blanker

Here are 2 easy mods that will make the DX-394 noise blanker perform
better. The performance on AM is marginal and doesn't work at all on
CW/SSB. The mods will improve the AM blanker performance significantly and
allow it to work on CW/SSB.

1. Remove the bottom cover with the front of the receiver facing you.
Bridge a 150K resistor across R180. This resistor is the third component
toward the front from Q32 (don't count Q32). R180 should be black with 224
(220K) on it (microscopes at the ready- Ed). This will re-bias Q33's base
to a more sensitive threshold.

2. Find Q34. It is to the right of Q32. Solder a Schottky diode (1N5817 or
similar) from the collector of Q34 to a ground trace. The anode of the
diode should go to ground and the cathode (banded end) to the collector of
Q34. The collector is the single pin on the side of the transistor facing
the rear of the receiver. A 1N4148 or 1N914 will work but not as well. This
mod will now let the noise blanker work in the CW/SSB mode. It allows
capacitor C182 to reset (discharge) in between noise pulses.

3. Replace the bottom cover and remove the top cover and find potentiometer
VR1 (close to the front of the unit). Set the pot about midway and you are
finished (Leave the pot alone at first. Adjust later after you have checked
out the mods).

This is a list of Mods from Deja News, the WWW gateway to uselessnet.

Crosstalk Mods

1) For those with DX-394s with adjacent channel "crosstalk" problems here
is a fix that will considerably reduce the problem. This applies to strong
AM stations within 10 to 30kHz of the station you are receiving that "bleed
over" and can be heard in the background. I am NOT referring to sideband
splatter from adjacent stations caused by the overly wide stock CF1 AM
ceramic filter. The problem is caused by the fact that Tandy designers (or
whoever) forgot one of the CF1 bias decoupling capacitors.

Anyone with a schematic will note that the node at the junction of R58,
R61, R62 and R64 should have a bypass capacitor to ground from this point.
Without it there is a resistive signal paththrough R57, R58, and R61 that
bypasses the CF1 filter and causes broadband bleedthrough. All that is
necessary is to solder a 0.047 to 0.2uf ceramic capacitor directly across
R64 and the crosstalk will be significantly reduced.

For those of you without a schematic you can find R64 by removing the
bottom cover with the receiver knobs facing you. Find the silk-screen
indent for D15. This is a four leaded surface mount, dual diode package.
R64 is the third component to the right of D15 and has 222 (2.2K) stamped
on it(you may need a magnifying glass!) This resistor is also just below
and slightly to the right of the third pin (from the left) on CF1. It
should be noted that with real strong adjacent signals there still may be
some crosstalk, and reducing the Fr gain will help even more.

Good luck and be careful - the parts are all tiny surface mount.

Another note for those who listen to AM only on the 394 - if you swap
ceramic filters CF1 and CF2 you will have a narrowwer AM bandwidth for
crowded band conditions. Unfortunately, the SSB and CW will now be wider!

2) Here is another DX-394 modification that will further reduce adjacent
channel crosstalk from strong short-wave stations (see above). This one may
be more effective than the previous one and, used together, crosstalk is
reduced to an insignificant level.

With the bottom cover removed and the front panel knobs facing you find the
silk-screen indent for Q13. It is a black surface mount transistor with
three leads (2 on one side, 1 on the other) midway toward the front of the
unit and left of center. Resistor R91 is just below it and should be marked
with 102 (1K). Bridge this resistor with a 0.1uf or 0.22uf ceramic
capacitor (keep leads short) and you're done.

IF signals preceding the ceramic filters are injected into the noise
blanker transistor Q13 and are somehow amplified and then capacitively
coupled around the ceramic filters via this circuit path. I have not
figured exactly how this happens yet. Adding the 0.1uf capacitor around
Q13's emitter resistor R91 (it already has a 0.01uf cap across it - C81)
seems to decouple the bleedthrough signal. The operation of the noise
blanker is not affected at all.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGC Mod

Got the service manual and found the cap that sets the AGC timing! This mod
will give a nice attack and release time (otherwise slow it down) and only
involves putting a 100uf / 16V (or better) electrolytic cap across C163. I
chose this value to my liking but you may speed it up or make it slower by
increasing or decreasing the value. C163 is located on the bottom of the
main board with the radio knobs facing you. It is to the right near center
just below Q9 with four surface mount components to it's left. Put the +
side of your caps towards Q9. A shielded cable could be brought out to a
small switch and back to one of the cap's leads to select fast and slow if
you wish- I am currently using 47uf for fast and 220uf for slow with a
SMALL mini spdt switch mounted just above the headphone jack. It's a tight
squeeze but entirely possible!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gain Control

This modification will improve the linearity of the DX-394's RF Gain
control and make it easier to use the RF gain as a volume control for SSB
signals. It will give the gain control better resolution so that the roll
off won't all occur in the last 40 degrees or so of the knob (in the CCW
position). To implement the mod solder a 4.7K or 5.1K resistor across
resistor R184. This resistor is located in the right rear of the main PC
board when facing it with the bottom cover removed and the knobs facing
you. One end of it is connected to pin 4 of connector CN4 (has 5 pins
total), which is located just in front of the 12 volt dc input jack J5 on
the rear panel.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Timer Mods

One glaring omission on this otherwise fine (with mods) little radio is the
lack of an output jack to switch on a tape recorder for use with the 5
built-in timers. I have added a small 12-volt relay that is energized
whenever the receiver is powered-up, and a jack on the back tied to the
relay's normally open contacts. The switched 12 (13.8 actually) volts is
easily obtained across C140.

With the receiver on its back, C140 is in the front right corner of the
board, and there is a handy metal shelf nearby that is perfect for
attaching a small relay. I simply glued the relay on its back on that shelf
and ran the coil wires across C140, and the contacts out to the jack.

A few caveats:
*Use a small relay so as not to leach off TOO much juice. Most tape
recorder's remote inputs don't need a large set of contacts, and besides
space is limited.
*Make sure that you put a clamping diode across the coil contacts if there
is not one inside the relay already. The cathode (banded) end is tied to
the + side of C140.
*This ultra-simple mod gave me fits for a while trying to get it to work
with my cassette recorder until I figured out that the remote input needs
isolated switch contacts, and didn't like one side of the of the jack tied
to the radio chassis (ga-DUH!). I had to enlarge the mounting hole for the
jack so it didn't touch, and also mounted the jack between 2 pieces of
rubber to keep it off chassis ground.

With this small addition the 394's timers become truly useful. I always
wondered that their point was if you had to be at the radio anyway to catch
the program you set the timer for! Now the set-up is automatic and I can
record whatever, whenever.....a simple mod that should have come standard.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Antenna Input

If you look at the schematic you will find that the Hi-Z input is coupled
through a 15pf capacitor which will have significant attenuation when
coupling to a random wire of the length you are using, so using the Low-Z
input is actually best. As far as longwave goes the Hi-Z input probably
gives better coupling to the first RF stage since it bypasses the front-end
RF coils' primary winding. The 65' total antenna length is very short
electrically for LW so the antenna appears very Hi-Z itself and the
impedance match is more appropriate. Find a 2 to 5 mH (that's millihenry)
Fr choke and put it in series with the antenna for LW, connect it to the
Low-Z input and you should see a marked improvement in signal to noise.
