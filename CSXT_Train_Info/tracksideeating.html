  <TD>Only about 2 blocks or so from the tracks and the food is outstanding. Only six bucks for a whopping portion of country fried steak, three sides, and a bottomless bucket of sweet tea.</TD>

  <TD>Biltmore Depot Restaurant</TD>
  <TD>NS</TD>
  <TD>Saluda Line</TD>
  <TD>Both are at the east end of Asheville yard, where US25 crosses the tracks in Biltmore, right where the NS lines to Black Mountain and points east and to Saluda grade and points south diverge. On the south side of the junction is the Depot Restaurant, located in the old station where the Vanderbilts used to detrain to go to their estate, the entrance to which is just west of the station. Train <BR>views are somewhat restricted from this restaurant, right on the tracks, but still interesting place to eat, surrounded by lots of history. Often westbound trains stop at the home signal controlling entrance to the yard and the engines idle right in front of the station until cleared to enter yard. This station was in active <BR>passenger service until Southern RR quit passenger trains in 1972. </TD>
  <TD> Fresh grilled seafood, veal, prime rib, burgers, salads, soups.  Chicken,s teaks, sandwiches and pasta. Lunch and dinner 7 days a week.   All major credit cards.</TD>

  <TD>Saluda Line</TD>
  <TD>Italian place, good food with good views of the junction from booths on the south side and the porch in front. At Trevi last evening, saw 4 trains in an hour. Sometimes they come out of Asheville yard to the yard limit sign then back in to do switching causing horrendous traffic backup on 25 at the crossing. Train <BR>activity on the Saluda line seems down from last year, but I don't <BR>necessarily hear (depends on wind direction) all of them as my cabin <BR>is on the opposite side of the mountain east of the line.</TD>
