NOTES:
     SLUG 600, aka SLUG 01, an E-2 Hawkeye from Norfolk's VAW-78, 
     was CLEARANCE 1.  He returned to Norfolk after the scrub this 
     morning and will be back tonight for the launch attempt. 
     According to a phone patch he made to DSN 565-1646, they will 
     prepare him for immediate return to Patrick [where the pilot 
     can retrieve the pager the pilot misplaced at Base Ops ;-D ].
     As usual, FAA acft PATROL 1 and PATROL 2 returned to Patrick, 
     while PATROL 3 returned to Melbourne IAP.  PATROL 3 seems to be 
     the senior or commander of the FAA STS support operation. 
     (Remember, it was PATROL 3 who pursued the acft that intruded 
     on launch-restricted airspace seconds before the Glenn launch.)  
     RELAY 1 also flew from and returned to Melbourne IAP.
     CG 2139, an HU-25C from CGAS Miami, flew a range clearance 
     pattern around N29-33, W079-09.  After the scrub, he returned 
     to his base (Opa Locka Airport). [For tonight's launch attempt 
     CG 6530, an HH-65 Aerospatiale Dolphin from CGAS Miami, will 
     work.]
     The SRB Recovery Ships Freedom Star and Liberty Star were 
     stationed at N30-04, W78-30. NASA 955, a T-38, took off at 
     1:00am and 2:45am, and flew around the launch area, reporting 
     cloud and wind conditions to "WEATHER COORDINATOR" on 126.65.  
     He also made a couple of simulated Shuttle Landings on SLF 
     Rnwys 15 and 33, right before the launch window, to report 
     conditions the STS would experience if forced to land right 
     after launch. He made many of his observations using NVGs.
     On comms from the Orbiter, the astronauts identify 
     themselves by their position; e.g., CDR-1 for the commander, 
     MS-1 and MS-2 for mission specialists.
